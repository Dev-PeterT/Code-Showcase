# Game-Dev-Tool-Kits | Guided Projectile

## Overview
`GuidedProjectile` is a **flexible Unity C# base class** for creating projectiles with various guidance systems in both **2D** and **3D**.  
It‚Äôs designed for **reusability and extension**, making it suitable for homing missiles, magic spells, or AI-controlled weapons.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **2D & 3D Support** ‚Äì works with both `Rigidbody2D` and `Rigidbody`.
- **Guidance Modes**:
	- **Guided** ‚Äì Tracks a moving or static target in real-time.
	- **Controlled** ‚Äì Moves based on player input (e.g., joystick).
	- **Unguided** ‚Äì Moves in a straight path based on initial direction.
	- **Predictive** ‚Äì Estimates and intercepts a moving target‚Äôs future position.
- **Customizable Movement**:
	- Adjustable `projectileSpeed` and `projectileTurnSpeed` for fine-tuned control.
- **Flexible Targeting**:
	- Supports both `Transform` targets and `Vector3` positional targeting.
- **Extendable Input Logic**:
	- Override `ProjectileInput` for custom input handling in controlled mode.

## üõ† Usage

### 1. Inherit the Class
```csharp
	public class MyClass : GuidedProjectile {
		... Your Code
	}
```

### 2. Implement in FixedUpdate
```csharp
	void FixedUpdate () {
		ProjectileInput(InputVector); // Only if in Controlled mode
		ProjectileGuidanceDirection();
	}
```
